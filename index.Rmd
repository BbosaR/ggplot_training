# Pipe

* ceci n'est pas un pipe `%>%` 

* It allows you to chain several `R` commands together `r emo::ji("smile")`

* The idea is to  have `R` codes as `x %>% f` rather than `f(x)`. This is an old concept in Linux and Unix systems.

* There are other pipe operators (`%T>%`, `%$%`, `%<>%`) in `magrittr`

* Term coined by `Leland Wilkinson` expanded to layered grammar of graphics by `Hadley Wickham`.

* *"A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics"*.

* The concept is essentially a set of rules that allows us to think of a statistical graphic beyond a certain name and format. 
]

# Grammar of graphics 2

* With this tool, you don't have to think about a scatter or box plot, but what set of information should I put on this graph to convey the message I want. 

* A plot is any name you give it. While the elements of the plots are merely verbs.

* Hence, you can have a boxplot with scatter points on it if you so desire. Actually, that exists `r emo::ji("smile")`

# Week five topic two: Producing plots with `ggplot2`

* `ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

* To achieve excellent plot, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

* `ggplot2` functions like data in the 'long' format, i.e., a column for every dimension, and a row for every observation. Well-structured data will save you lots of time when making figures with ggplot2.

* `ggplot2` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.


---

# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* To build a `ggplot`, we will use the following basic template that can be used for different types of plots:

```{r}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + <GEOM$\_$FUNCTION>()
```


# Importing data into R environment or console.

```{r}
train<-read.csv("training_data.csv", header=T)
```

* `Load package`

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
```

---

# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* Use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using `data` argument:

```{r}
ggplot(data = train)
```


# Methods

```{r}
head(train) #... to visualize the data
```

* Specify an aesthetic mapping (using the aesthetic `(aes)` function), and selecte the variables to be plotted by specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes(x, y))
```
---
# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* Add `geoms` - graphical representations of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including:
```{r}
geom_point() # for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
```

```{r}
geom_boxplot() # for boxplots
```

```{r}
geom_line()} # for trend lines, time series, etc.
```
* `For instance`
```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_line()
```

---
# Producing scatter plots

* We use `+` operator to add a `geom` to the plot. In this case, we use `geom_point()` because we want a scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
geom_point()
```
.pull-left[
<img src="picture/scatter.jpg" width="380" height="350">]

.pull-right[

* The `"+"` operator is useful for modifying existing `ggplot` objects. 

* That is, we can easily set up plot template and explore different types of plots.
]

---

# Scatter plot Cont'd

* We can re-write the code above like this:

```{r}
scatterplot <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

scatterplot + geom_point() # to plot
```

.pull-left[
<img src="picture/scatter.jpg" width="380" height="350">]

.pull-right[

* Anytime `ggplot()` is used, the function can be seen by any geom layers that we added (i.e., these are universal plot settings).

* This includes the x- and y-axis we set up in `aes()`.

* We can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.

]

---

# Scatter plot Cont'd

.pull-left[

* The '+' sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing a layer. 

* If, otherwise, the `'+'` sign is added in the line before the other layer, ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

* This is the correct syntax for adding layers:

```{r}
scatterplot +
  geom_point()
```

* This will not add the new layer and will return an error message:

```{r}
scatterplot 
+geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[

# Building plots iteratively

* Building plots with `ggplot2` is typically an iterative process.

* We start by specifying the dataset, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r}
ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
geom_point()
```
]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We modify th plot by adding transparency (alpha) to avoid overplotting:

```{r}
scatmod <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod+
geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

]

.pull-right[
<img src="picture/scatter2.jpg" width="320" height="300">]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We can also add colours for all the points:

```{r}
scatmod2 <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod2+
geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color ='blue')
```

]

.pull-right[
<img src="picture/scatter3.jpg" width="320" height="300">]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We can also colour each species in the plot differently.

```{r}
scatmod3 <- ggplot(data = train, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod3 +
geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id))
```

]

.pull-right[
<img src="picture/scatter4.jpg" width="320" height="300">]



---
# Producing Boxplot

.pull-left[

* Using Boxplot for data visualization.

* For instance, let's visualize the distribution of weight within each species.

```{r}

scatmod4 + geom_boxplot()

]

---
# Producing Boxplot Cont'd

.pull-left[

* Adding points to the boxplot to have a good idea of the number of measurements and of their distribution:

```{r}
scatmod5 <- ggplot(data = train, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) 

# to plot
scatmod5 + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
```

# Week five topic three: Producing Time series plot

.pull-left[
* To generate time series data from the dataset, we group the data and count records within each group.

```{r}
time_yearly <- train%>%
  count(year, genus)
```

* We can visualize the timelapse as a line plot with years on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = time_yearly, aes(x = year, y = n)) + geom_line()
```
]

.pull-right[

<img src="picture/time.jpg" width="320" height="300">
]
---
# Time series plot cont'd

.pull-left[
* Unlikely, this does not work because we plotted data for all the genera together. We need to tell `ggplot` to draw a line for each genus by modifying the aesthetic function to include group = `genus`

```{r}
ggplot(data = time_yearly, aes(x = year, y = n, group=genus)) + geom_line()
```
