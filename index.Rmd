# Assumptions

1. You have access to internet `r emo::ji("heavy_check_mark")`

2. You have some experience working with `R` `r emo::ji("question")`

3. You like cool graphics `r emo::ji("smile")`

## Desirable but not necessary

1. You have some experience with `tidyverse` and `piping(%>%)` `r emo::ji("+1")`


#### `r emo::ji("cross mark")` assumption 2  `r emo::ji("right arrow")` crash course in `R` and `tidyverse`

# `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `magrittr`

* `%>%` is called a pipe and it is made available in the `magrittr` package.
* It allows you to put the result of an `R` code in another `R` code.

* Term coined by `Leland Wilkinson` expanded to layered grammar of graphics by `Hadley Wickham`.

* *"A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics"*.

* The concept is essentially a set of rules that allows us to think of a statistical graphic beyond a certain name and format.

# Grammar of graphics 2

* With this tool, you don't have to think about a scatter or box plot, but what set of information should I put on this graph to convey the message I want. 

* A plot is any name you give it. While the elements of the plots are merely verbs.

* To
