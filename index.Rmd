# Pipe

* ceci n'est pas un pipe `%>%` 

* It allows you to chain several `R` commands together `r emo::ji("smile")`

* The idea is to  have `R` codes as `x %>% f` rather than `f(x)`. This is an old concept in Linux and Unix systems.

* There are other pipe operators (`%T>%`, `%$%`, `%<>%`) in `magrittr`

# Notes

* The slides above do not describe a tip of the iceberg when it comes to tidyverse
* Should you run into any problem, just Google the error message you get from `R`
* Twitter is also a fun place to learn these days
* Follow [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typeahead_click) and [@tidyversetweets](https://twitter.com/tidyversetweets) for some cool visualizations and tidyverse tricks
* Check [https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/) for free resources on tidyverse

# `Some DIY`

1. Using the participants data, extract another dataset containing all `student` participants.

2. Repeat the same action in 1 for `academic researchers`

3. What is the `gender frequency` for the participants?

4. What `other training` is of interest to the participants? Rank this table in `descending` order.

* Term coined by `Leland Wilkinson` expanded to layered grammar of graphics by `Hadley Wickham`.

* *"A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics"*.

* The concept is essentially a set of rules that allows us to think of a statistical graphic beyond a certain name and format.

# Enters `ggplot2`

* ggplot2 is the `R` package that allows you implement (layered) grammar of graphics

* This package is a product of `Hadley Wickham's` PhD.

## Why the Fuss about ggplot2

* `ggplot2` is one of the most downloaded `R` package. Let's check how many [downloads](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/cran-explorer/?_ga=2.106534406.467526461.1596478926-765883120.1595676024)

* ggplot2 follows a clear and consistent syntax `ggplot(aes()) + geom_*()`. We will see more of this next week.

* Nice set of [extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

* Vast amount of [resources](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about)

 ** Before next Tuesday, kindly download this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) and study this [resources](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) *

`Basic ggplot2 functions (ggplot and qplot)` <br>

`Basic plots with ggplot2` <br>

# Basic ggplot2 functions

* `qplot` is sort of the easy way out so we will leave that till the end of this week's lesson. 

* Let us dive into ggplot2 as an artist rather than someone looking for a quick fix.

* As earlier mentioned, ggplot2 follows a consistent and easy syntax. **ggplot() + geom_* + ...  **

* The `ggplot()` command creates a basic canvas for you, on which you then add whatever you want to this canvas with a `+`

* Hence, the word `ggplot()` is the basic function with which you start a chart.

* Type the code below in your R session

```{r chk8, eval = FALSE}
?ggplot
```

* **data** is the dataset you would like to plot and **mapping** is the aesthetics.

---

# Aesthetics

* Think of aesthetics, `aes()`, as the part of your dataset you want to map to things on your plot.

* ggplot expects that everything in an `aes()` statement to be a variable.

* Since `aes()` is a function itself, it has arguments.

```{r chk9, eval = FALSE}
?aes
```

* **x** and **y** are arguments for the variables you would like on x and y axis respectively.

* other arguments you can pass include; `fill`, `linetype`, `size`, `color`, `group`, etc.

---

# `geom_*`

* After setting up the canvas, you can start drawing. 

* You do this by adding geoms.

* There are quite a number of geoms. Hence, the cheatsheet.

* Popular ones includes; `geom_line()`, `geom_point()`, `geom_area()`, `geom_tile()`, `geom_errorbar()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_bar`, `geom_bar`, etc.

* Let's see them all in action.

# Basic plots with ggplot2 (The basic canvas)

```{r chk10a, eval =FALSE}

  ggplot(aes(x = `Are you familiar with R software?`))

.pull-right[
```{r chk10b, echo=FALSE}
participants_data %>% filter(Gender == "Female") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Are you familiar with R software?`))
```
]

* As earlier mentioned, the `ggplot()` command just gives you a basic canvas which you can then draw on.

---

# Basic plots with ggplot2 (`geom_bar`)

.pull-left[
```{r chk11a, eval =FALSE}
participants_data %>% filter(Gender == "Female") %>%

# Round up

* As you might have noticed, we tried to keep it simple, basic and clean.

* It is important for participants to properly understand these basics for what is to come next.

* Try to go through the cheasheet and resource provided last week and practice some more.

## `DIY`

Make a side by side barplot of the participants familiarity with `R`. Let the gender be on the x axis, the count on the y axis.

# Themes

* You can customize and write your own themes. However, there are some themes already existing in `ggplot2`.

* Inbuilt themes include; `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_dark()`, etc.

* There are packages built around theme customization, e.g. `ggpubr` which provides you with `theme_pubr()`

* Let's apply some of these available themes.

# Round up

* `labs()` allows you to set x and y axis titles as well as make changes to other parts of your plot.

* `theme()` allows you to customise a bunch of things about your graphs.

* You can always start from an existing theme and customize it to your satisfaction

* You can as well write your own theme from the scratch.

* Endeavour to read more using `?theme`, `?labs`.

## DIY

# Week five topic two: Producing plots with `ggplot2`

* `ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

* To achieve excellent plot, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

* `ggplot2` functions like data in the 'long' format, i.e., a column for every dimension, and a row for every observation. Well-structured data will save you lots of time when making figures with ggplot2.

* `ggplot2` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.


---

# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* To build a `ggplot`, we will use the following basic template that can be used for different types of plots:

```{r}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + <GEOM$\_$FUNCTION>()
```


# Importing data into R environment or console.

```{r}
train<-read.csv("training_data.csv", header=T)
```

* `Load package`

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
```

---

# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* Use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using `data` argument:

```{r}
ggplot(data = train)
```


# Methods

```{r}
head(train) #... to visualize the data
```

* Specify an aesthetic mapping (using the aesthetic `(aes)` function), and selecte the variables to be plotted by specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes(x, y))
```
---
# Producing plots with `ggplot2` Cont'd.

* Add `geoms` - graphical representations of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including:
```{r}
geom_point() # for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
```

```{r}
geom_boxplot() # for boxplots
```

```{r}
geom_line()} # for trend lines, time series, etc.
```
* `For instance`
```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = "", mapping = aes())+ geom_line()
```

---
# Producing scatter plots

* We use `+` operator to add a `geom` to the plot. In this case, we use `geom_point()` because we want a scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
geom_point()
```
.pull-left[
<img src="picture/scatter.jpg" width="380" height="350">]

.pull-right[

* The `"+"` operator is useful for modifying existing `ggplot` objects. 

* That is, we can easily set up plot template and explore different types of plots.
]

---

# Scatter plot Cont'd

* We can re-write the code above like this:

```{r}
scatterplot <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

scatterplot + geom_point() # to plot
```

.pull-left[
<img src="picture/scatter.jpg" width="380" height="350">]

.pull-right[

* Anytime `ggplot()` is used, the function can be seen by any geom layers that we added (i.e., these are universal plot settings).

* This includes the x- and y-axis we set up in `aes()`.

* We can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.

]

---

# Scatter plot Cont'd

.pull-left[

* The '+' sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing a layer. 

* If, otherwise, the `'+'` sign is added in the line before the other layer, ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

* This is the correct syntax for adding layers:

```{r}
scatterplot +
  geom_point()
```

* This will not add the new layer and will return an error message:

```{r}
scatterplot 
+geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[

# Building plots iteratively

* Building plots with `ggplot2` is typically an iterative process.

* We start by specifying the dataset, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r}
ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
geom_point()
```
]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We modify th plot by adding transparency (alpha) to avoid overplotting:

```{r}
scatmod <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod+
geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

]

.pull-right[
<img src="picture/scatter2.jpg" width="320" height="300">]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We can also add colours for all the points:

```{r}
scatmod2 <- ggplot(data = train, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod2+
geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color ='blue')
```

]

.pull-right[
<img src="picture/scatter3.jpg" width="320" height="300">]

---
# Scatter plot Cont'd
.pull-left[
* We can also colour each species in the plot differently.

```{r}
scatmod3 <- ggplot(data = train, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 

# to plot
scatmod3 +
geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id))
```

scatmod5 + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
```

# Week five topic three: Producing Time series plot

.pull-left[
* To generate time series data from the dataset, we group the data and count records within each group.

```{r}
time_yearly <- train%>%
  count(year, genus)
```

* We can visualize the timelapse as a line plot with years on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = time_yearly, aes(x = year, y = n)) + geom_line()
```
]

.pull-right[

<img src="picture/time.jpg" width="320" height="300">
]
---
# Time series plot cont'd

.pull-left[
* Unlikely, this does not work because we plotted data for all the genera together. We need to tell `ggplot` to draw a line for each genus by modifying the aesthetic function to include group = `genus`

```{r}
ggplot(data = time_yearly, aes(x = year, y = n, group=genus)) + geom_line()
```

## Proponent(s) of Facets
.pull-left[

* **Facets** were popularised by Edward Tuffe in his 1983 book, *The Visual Display of Quantivative Information*, from a concept of small multiples.
<img src="picture/book_cover.PNG" width="300" height="300"/>
]

.pull-right[
* The idea is that we can spread up a small part to produce multiple 
smaller parts that have the same cordinate system.

Taking an example of tips per total bill

![](picture/tips.png)
]

---
## **Purpose of Facets**

Faceting helps to split the data up into groups, according to a categorical variable, then plots each group in its own panel.

![](picture/tips2.png)

---
## Install the required packages and load the libraries

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("tidyverse")

library(ggplot2)

library(reshape2)

* Inspect the variables in `tips` data set from `reshape` library
```{r}
names(tips)
head(tips)
str(tips)
```

---
## Formula notation

Faceting splits the data up into groups, according to a categorical variable, 
then plots each group in its own panel. 

For splitting the data by one or two categorical variables, `facet_grid()` is 
used. As well as the `vars()` notation for specifying which variables should
be used to split the dataset into facets.

* To divide by "sex" vertically;-

```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=total_bill, 
                 y=tip/total_bill)) + 
  geom_point(shape=1) + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(sex)) # or facet_grid(. ~ sex)
```

* To divide by "sex' horizontally;-

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
ggplot(tips, aes(x=total_bill, 
                 y=tip/total_bill)) + 
  geom_point(shape=1) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex)) # or facet_grid(sex ~ .)
```

## **How to Add two categories**
In order to add two categories, both the `rows` and `cols` arguments in `facet_grid` are used.

![](picture/tips5.png)

---
## **Using geom_bar chart**

Using WDI data from the World Bank, population demographics can be categorised as Urban and Rural. Data was obtained from 2015 to 2018 for the Southern Africa countries namely Eswatini, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia , Zimbabwe, Namibia,Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana and Angola.

Using the 'Rural_Urban_lg.csv' file, first inspect the variables in the dataset


```{r}
Rural_Urban_lg <- read.csv("~/UI_LISA/Training_2/ggplot_training/Data/Rural_Urban_lg.csv", 
                          header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(Rural_Urban_lg) # To know the list of all variables 
str(Rural_Urban_lg) # To know the structure of the given variables
head(Rural_Urban_lg) # To know the first 6 rows (observations)
tail(Rural_Urban_lg) # To know the last 6 rows (observations)
```


---
## **Plotting the bar chart**
```{r}
ggplot(Rural_Urban_lg, aes(country, Total_Pop, fill= country)) +
  geom_bar(aes(reorder(country, Total_Pop),Total_Pop),
           stat= "identity", show.legend = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")+
  facet_grid(Pop_Setting ~ year ,labeller= label_context, 
              scales = "free") +
  geom_text(aes(label= Total_Pop), hjust=-0.1, colour="black",
             size=2.2, angle=90) +
  ylab("Proportion of population (%)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust =1, vjust=0.2))
```

## Change the text of facet labels
.pull-left[
You can assign proper labels in your original data before plotting.

The default value is `label_value` which displays only the value

Common alternatives are:

`label_both`: Displays both the value and the variable name
`label_context`: Displays only the values or both the values and variables depending on whether multiple factors are faceted
